This is a slightly modified version of a study project I did at the codecool.com bootcamp.

The task was to provision an nginx installation in a virtual machine with Vagrant,
and to serve a test web page on the loopback interface of the host machine on a
custom-configured port.

Required software:
-----------------
You need to install VirtualBox ( https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads )
and Vagrant ( https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads ) to be able to run the code
in this repository.
